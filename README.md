# Network-Diag-Tool
I am making a Network diagnostic tool in the executable format ( .exe), it will use CMD commands. 

This is a tool I made to provide network diagnostics and you some time from typing all the commands out.
If you have any command suggestions please let me know.

Folder should include:

NET_DIAG_TOOL.exe
NET_DIAG_TOOL SOURCE CODE.bat
NET_DIAG_TOOL SOURCE CODE.txt
NET_DIAG_TOOL NO ADMIN.exe
NET_DIAG_TOOL SOURCE CODE NO ADMIN.bat
NET_DIAG_TOOL SOURCE CODE NO ADMIN.txt


Please use the Admin required version to ensure it runs smoothly.

Use the software as you want (As long as it is not maliscious)

If you have any suggestions to improve the software please let me know at:
